# Contributing

If you have any questions about [thebroonline.com][0] please feel free to [raise an issue][2].

Please [search existing issues][1] for the same feature and/or issue before raising a new issue. Commenting on an
existing issue is usually preferred over raising duplicate issues.

Ensure that all files confirm to the coding standards. This can be done easily via command-line:

``` bash
# install/update package dependencies
$ npm install
# run test suite
$ grunt test
```

You will need to have [node.js][3] for this, but you should also need to install (if you haven't done so already) the
[Grunt][4] command-line tool:

``` bash
$ npm install -g grunt
```

Use the same coding style as the rest of the [code base][0].

All pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch.

Don't forget to add your details to the list of [AUTHORS.md][5] if you want your contribution to be recognized by
others.
